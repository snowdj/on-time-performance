The goal is to uncover interesting insights, in the form of frequentist and/or inferential analysis. There are many users (airline passengers) of the data and we’d like to provide some ideas that may help them in their travels.

Those that will review your presentation have both technical and non-technical backgrounds.

Our onsite interview is usually half a day or so, mainly focused around the candidate presenting the results of their analysis of the BoT data.  Usually they create a notebook of some kind, using R Markdown or Jupyter or something like that.  We're looking for both the ability to mine the data for interesting and useful insights, and the ability to present well and explain complex concepts to a non-technical audience.
